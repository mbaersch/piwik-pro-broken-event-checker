        "\n",
        "## Why a \"Broken Event Checker\"?\n",
        "Piwik PRO counts events that cannot be processed as *broken events*. They do not appear in reports beyond real-time... and in your hit stats. That means, that broken events count towards your limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you are not able to catch such an event, it is very hard to tell whatÂ´s wrong.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Using the Debugger API\n",
        "Piwik PRO offers a separate API to access data from the tracking debugger. Every event and information about the session and visitor are available here. A different endpoint even allows to receive the raw incoming requests, including header and all parameters ans values.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is valuable information if you want to find out, when and why broken events occur... and hopefully can fix the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "This example is a step-by-step walkthrough of the following tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "- use Python to get data out of the API for the last x minutes\n",
        "- look for broken events\n",
        "- send a message via Slack if broken events are found\n",
        "\n",
        "This code is meant to be executed regularly. In [the example repository](https://github.com/mbaersch/piwik-pro-broken-event-checker) are some ideas how to do that. This notebook serves more as a demo for the different steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Using Slack Apps\n",
        "The function provided in this example uses a webhook to send Slack messages. For more information about how to receive messages in Slack using a Webhook visit [this help article from Slack](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).\n"
